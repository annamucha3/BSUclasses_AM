            <h2>Chapter 1: IPython</h2>
            <p>
                IPython is an interactive interface to Python. It can allow for interactive browser-based development.

            <h2>Chapter 2: Understanding Data Types</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding data types in Python is a great place to start when beginning. This is an important piece of understanding the language.
            </p>
            <p>
                A list can be used to hold integers. There is great flexibility when using lists. With NumPy, you have the ability to create an array from a list.
            </p>
            <p>
                These are just some of the many data types that are possible options. Loops can be very slow; implementing UFuncs is a great way to speed up execution times.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ufunc has many operations such as add, subtract, divide, multiply, mod, and power.

            <h2>Chapter 3: Pandas</h2>
            <p>
                Pandas has three main data structures: Series, DataFrame, and Index.
            </p>
            <p>
                A series can be created from a list or an array, as a NumPy array, and as a dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                A DataFrame is an analog of a two-dimensional array, which is different from a Series, which is only a one-dimensional array. A DataFrame can also be thought of as a specialization of a dictionary.
            </p>
            <p>
                An Index allows for slicing or retrieving certain values.
            </p>

            <h2>Chapter 4: Matplotlib</h2>
            <p>
                Matplotlib is a Python package used for visualization purposes.
            </p>
            <p>
                With Matplotlib, one is able to easily create line plots, scatterplots, histograms, bar charts, and much more. This package allows for a great range of customizations.
